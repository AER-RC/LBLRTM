# Local Version

The `master` branch of hosted in GitHub *is* the local version of LBLRTM. Releases are in "Releases" and have tags. At AER, we have a single clone accessible to everyone for the purpose of having a single build to which we can all point (`/nas/project/rc/rc1/lblrtm_local_version`), but this clone IS NOT FOR DEVELOPMENT! For developing the model, please refer to the [Incoming section](#Incoming).

# Incoming <a href="Incoming"></a>

Incoming is no more. If you have contrbutions to make, branch off of master, make your edits, push to your branch, then create a merge request as soon as your commit has been pushed. Owners and/or maintainers will then execute the merge if it is acceptable.

# Documentation

Document this model at will. `FAQ_LBLRTM.doc` has been removed from version control (and its PDF cousin will be gone, too) and converted to Markdown format and is now the top-level `README.md`. This README is the first place we should consider placing general information. Things for specific projects or special cases should have their own page in the [Wiki](https://github.com/AER-RC/LBLRTM/wiki).
