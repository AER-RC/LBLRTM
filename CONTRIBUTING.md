# Local Version

The `master` branch of hosted in GitHub *is* the local version of LBLRTM. Releases are in "Releases" and have tags. At AER, we may have a single clone accessible to everyone for the purpose of having a single build to which we can all point, but this clone IS NOT FOR DEVELOPMENT! For developing the model, please refer to the "Incoming" section.

# Incoming

Incoming is no more. If you have contrbutions to make, branch off of master, make your edits, push to your branch, the create a merge request as soon as your commit has been pushed.
