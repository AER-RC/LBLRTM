LBLRTM_v10.0

1) Modified the Analytic Jacobian calculations to be more efficient and accurate.
   (S.A. Clough)

2) Added the capability to scale the molecular profile values
   (S.A. Clough)

3) MT_CKD_v1.3 : Modified CO2 continuum based primarly on LBLRTM validations with SHIS/TES/AIRS observations
   (M.W. Shephard)

4) Correction for horizontal propagation with aerosols for any altitude above 1 m (0.001 km).
   (T. Scharlemann and S.A. Clough)   

5) Modified LBLRTM implementation of TIPS so that it can handle molecules with HITRAN
   molecule numbers larger than 33.
   (S.A. Clough and M.W. Shephard)

6) Also, available for the LBLRTM calculations are additonal CO2 P/Q/R line coupling adapted
   from Niro et al. (2005) for the CO2 v2 (600-800 cm-1). The line coupling
   parameters are provide with LNFL (www.rtweb.aer.com).  LNFL will merges the line
   coupling paramters with a spectroscopic line database to create input spectroscopic 
   parameters for LBLRTM.

LBLRTM_v9.4

1) Fixed a minor bug in the hydrostatic calculation where a variable name was
   mistyped.

2) Modified the double precision f90 makefile for OS X.  


LBLRTM_v9.3

1) Fixed a minor bug in the analytic derivative computation.
   (H. Snell)

LBLRTM_v9.2

1) A correction to the collision induced nitrogen absorption in the 0-350 cm-1 region
   has been implemented.  The magnitude of the increase is ~35% from 0 to 250 cm-1.
   (S.A. Clough and R. Tipping)

LBLRTM_v9.1

1)The foreign water vapor continuum has been modified in the 250 - 500 cm-1 region to 
  provide improved agreement with AERI_extended_range measurements from SHEBA and 
  North Slope of Alaska (NSA).  The consequence is that in this spectral region, 
  the mt_ckd_1.1 foreign continuum provides results similar to those previously 
  obtained with ckd_2.4.1 (S.A. Clough and J. Delamere).

LBLRTM_v9.0

1) Implementation of analytic Jacobians/derivatives in LBLRTM. This effort was supported 
   by EUMETSAT and designed to require a minimal amount of setup on the part of 
   the user while exploiting pre-existing LBLRTM calculation options.  Refer to user
   instructions and additional documentation for more details.   
   (H. Snell, M.W. Shephard, S.A. Clough, and S. Tjemkes)  

LBLRTM_v8.4

1) Minor bug fixs to the LOWTRAN7 routin in LBLRTM (lbllow.f) that
   includes the moving of an ENDIF to the proper location and the
   proper alignment of ZMDL and ALTZ arrays
   (S.A. Clough and S. Shald)

2) In the continuum module, the coding of the partial pressure of water vapor has
   been simplified by introducing a varaiable h2o_frac.  The factor of 1.e-20 has
   been removed from Wtot.  In conjunction with this, the factor of 1e-20 has been 
   removed from the calculation of fractions for the other species, including the 
   Rayleigh scattering section.
   (S.A. Clough)

3) The common blocks in several subroutines have been modified to eliminate compiler
   Warning Messages
   (S.A. Clough)

4) Minor bug fix in postsub.f 
   (S.A. Clough)

5) Changes to xmerge.f to get it ready for analytic derivation implementation. 
   (H. Snell)


LBLRTM_v8.3

1) Minor bug fix in SCNMRG subroutine.
   (M.W. Shephard and J. Gu)

LBLRTM_v8.2

1) Minor bug fix to the LOWTRAN7 routine in LBLRTM (lbllow.f), which accounts
   for clouds and aerosols.
   (S.A. Clough)

2) Added makefiles and utilities to run LBLRTM on LINUX INTEL.
   (M.W. Shephard and H. Nair) 

LBLRTM_v8.1


1) The partition function routine has been changed to TIPS_2003
    Fischer,J., R.R. Gamache, A. Goldman, L.S. Rothman and A. Perrin.
    Total internal partition sums for molecular species in the 2000
    edition of the HITRAN database, JQSRT 2003;82:401-412.
    (S.A. Clough)

2) The number of molecules that can be handled is 38, consistent with 
   HITRAN 2000.
   (S.A. Clough)

3) The chi factor for carbon dioxide has been modified.  The chi factor is 
   now computed in a separate subroutine.
   (S.A. Clough)

4) The cumulus cloud option is now working. 
   (S.A. Clough and M.W. Shephard)

5) The line coupling coefficients for the oxygen lines in the microwave 
   region have been modified based on the data of Cimini et al. (2003).
   (K. Cady-Pereira and S.A. Clough)

6) The method of handling the temperature correction for transitions with  
   unknown lower state energies has been modified.
   (S.A. Clough and M.W. Shephard)

7) The CO2 Mixing Ratio parameter read from TAPE5 (if non zero) prevails 
   over all other input values.  This provides a ready means to globally 
   change the carbon dioxide mixing ratio.
   (S.A. Clough)

8) Spectral range over which carbon dioxide continuum has been increased 
   by a factor of 7.0 has been extended to 0-1200 cm-1.
   (S.A. Clough)

LBLRTM_v7.04

1) The interface between LBLRTM and LOWTRAN7 has been updated to 
   run operationally (i.e. including aerosols and clouds).
   (S.A. Clough, M.W. Shephard, and S. Tjemkes)

2) To function more efficiently as a stand alone program the common
   blocks in LBLATM has been made more consistent.
   (S.A. Clough and D. Turner)


LBLRTM_v7.03

1) There was code implemented to report and skip over spectral lines that
   cannot be handled properly by TIPS in LBLRTM.
   (H. Snell and S.A. Clough)

2) Pressures adjacent to 35 km in the built in US STD ATMOS was modified. 
   (W.O. Gallery)


LBLRTM_v7.01

1) Completely new water vapor continuum model (0-20,000 cm-1):  MT_CKD_1.00
    See the release notes for the MT_CKD continuum for further details.
    (E.J. Mlawer, D.C Tobin and S.A. Clough)

2) LBLRTM modified to read the single precision SOLAR.RAD file when
    running LBLRTM in double precision (solar applications)
    (S.A. Clough).

3) Fixed a bug when using cross sections (XS directory) specified on
    pressure levels when the first reference altitude is zero.
    (M.W. Shephard)

4) For LBLATM (IATM=1), volume mixing ratio values on TAPE6 (output) have
    been changed from ppv to ppmv with the units indicated in the text.
    This provides consistency with volume mixing ratio input for LBLATM (TAPE5).
    Note that the vmr variables internal to the code are ppv.
    (M.W. Shephard)

5) Increased the maximum number of LBLATM input levels from 3400 to 4000 in
    order to input full radiosonde profiles.
    (M.W. Shephard)

6) Increased the portability of LBLRTM by providing makefiles and utilities
    to run LBLRTM on IBM (AIX) and on OS X (Mac).
    (S.A. Clough, M.W. Shephard, P. VanDelst, A. Goldman)

   **f90** for compiling LINUX in double precision, the script "linux_dbl_script"
           must be executed which includes the appropriate makefile.

   LBLRTM has previously been run by us on DEC alpha, Cray, MS_dos, and HP
   platforms.  The associated utilities used are included in this release but are likely outdated.
