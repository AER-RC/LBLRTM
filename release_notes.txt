LBLRTM_v7.04

1) The interface between LBLRTM and LOWTRAN has been updated to 
   run operationally (i.e. including aerosols and clouds).
   (S.A. Clough, M.W. Shephard, and S. Tjemkes)

2) To function more efficiently as a stand alone program the common
   blocks in LBLRTM were made more consistent.
   (S.A. Clough and D. Turner)


LBLRTM_v7.03

1) There was code implemented to report and skip over spectral lines that
   cannot be handled properly by TIPS in LBLRTM.
   (H. Snell and S.A. Clough)

2) Pressures adjacent to 35 km in the built in US STD ATMOS was modified. 
   (W.O. Gallery)


LBLRTM_v7.01

1) Completely new water vapor continuum model (0-20,000cm-1):  MT_CKD_1.00
    See the release notes for the mt_ckd continuum for further details.
    (E.J. Mlawer, D.C Tobin and S.A. Clough)

2) LBLRTM modified to read the single precision SOLAR.RAD file when
    running LBLRTM in double precision (solar applications)
    (S.A. Clough).

3) Fixed a bug when using cross sections (XS directory) specified on
    pressure levels when the first reference altitude is zero.
    (M.W. Shephard)

4) For LBLATM (IATM=1), volume mixing ratio values on TAPE6 (output) have
    been changed from ppv to ppmv with the units indicated in the text.
    This provides consistency with volume mixing ratio input for LBLATM (TAPE5).
    Note that the vmr variables internal to the code are ppv.
    (M.W. Shephard)

5) Increased the maximum number of LBLATM input levels from 3400 to 4000 in
    order to input full radiosonde profiles.
    (M.W. Shephard)

6) Increased the portability of LBLRTM by providing makefiles and utilities
    to run LBLRTM on IBM (AIX) and on OS X (Mac).
    (S.A. Clough, M.W. Shephard, P. VanDelst, A. Goldman)

    Note: This version of LBLRTM has been executed on the following platforms:

     System     Mfr.        Compiler       sgl       dbl

   Makefiles are included for the compilers appearing in bold in the above table.

   **f90** for compiling LINUX in double precision, the script "linux_dbl_script"
           must be executed which includes the appropriate makefile.

   LBLRTM has previously been run by us on DEC alpha, Cray, MS_dos, and HP
   platforms.  The associated utilities used are included in this release but are likely outdated.
