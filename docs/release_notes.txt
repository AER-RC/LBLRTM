LBLRTM_v11.8
May 2010

1) The non-LTE routines have been updated to read an updated TAPE4 input format. 
   - The updated TAPE4 format puts the vibrational state information for each molecule 
   into the TAPE4 with the vibrational temperature profiles. Previously, vibrational 
   state information was hard-coded into the source code.  The updated TAPE4 format 
   also specifies the isotopologue number associated with each vibrational state.

   - Instruction manual was updated.

LBLRTM_v11.7
January 2010

1) MT_CKD_2.5 continuum modifications included in this release are based on analyses of 
IASI, AIRS, and AERI measurements in the region past the bandhead of the CO2 v3 band (~2385 cm-1):

	- Introduction of temperature dependence of carbon dioxide continuum absorption 
	from 2386-2434 cm-1 from IASI measurements (E.J. Mlawer and V.H. Payne)

	- Modification of carbon dioxide continuum coefficients from 2000-3000 cm-1 from 
	IASI and AERI (from ARM) measurements (E.J. Mlawer, V.H. Payne, and M.W. Shephard)

	- Modification of water vapor self continuum coefficients from 2000-3200 cm-1 from 
	IASI and AIRS measurements; fit based on near-IR studies of Bicknell et al. (2006) and 
	Fulghum and Tilleman (1991) (E.J. Mlawer and V.H. Payne)


LBLRTM_v11.6


1) There were several analytic Jacobian related issues resolved in this release.

-  Fixed an issue with TOA Jacobians producing NaN in the top layer. (S.A. Clough and Paolo Antonelli)

-  Fixed a documentation error in the LBLRTM instructions. (K.E. Cady-Pereira)

2) Fixed a coding error is the solar source function. (K.E. Cady-Pereria and S. Ferron)  

3) Modified LBLRTM to handle underflow problem in convolution routine. (M.W. Shephard, S.A. Clough, G. Uymin)

4) Modified the LBLRTM default option for zeroing very small atmospheric profile amounts. (S.A. Clough and Hal Woolf)

5)  MT_CKD_2.2: Solved the issue of N2 Jacobians being included in the Jacobians generated for other molecules (S.A. Clough and M.W. Shephard) 

6)  MT_CKD_2.3: Fixed an issue with the water vapor Jacobians in which the analytic Jacobians were dependent on the starting wavenumber. (K.E. Cady-Pereira and S. Tjemkes) 

7)  MT_CKD_2.4:  Modifications to the water vapor continuum arise from new analyses of ARM measurements in the microwave and far-IR regions (S.A. Clough, J. Delamere, V.H. Payne, E.J. Mlawer)

- Analyses of measurements in the microwave are based primarily on the two-channel
MWR (23.8 and 31.4 GHz) at SGP, with supporting evidence from 150 GHz MWRHF measurements during the COPS campaign and from 170 GHz GVRP measurements at SGP (Payne et al.,
2009). 

- Measurements in the far-IR were from the AERI_ext at the NSA site, in the time surrounding and including the RHUBC-I campaign (Delamere et al., 2009).

LBLRTM_v11.3

1) Included NO2 as a cross-section in list of cross-section molecule aliases. 
   Modified LBLRTM to include a default profile for NO2 when it is specified as a
   cross-section.  The default profile is identical to that when an NO2 profile is
   requested for use when NO2 lines are present. (J. Delamere, S.A. Clough)
        
2) Molecules number extended to include molecule # 39;  ch3oh
   (S.A. Clough)
        
3) Fixed an error in the scaling option.
   (J. Delamere, S.A. Clough) 

4) Corrected and indexing issue in the N2 continuum that effected calculations below 
   350 cm-1 (S.A. Clough, Bill Snow, Bob d'Entremont, M.W. Shephard)  


LBLRTM_v11.1

1) The continuum for co2 has been calculated using Niro et al. (2005) line coupling with a
   factor of 0.75 applied to the nu_3 band.  This factor was chosen to get the best 
   agreeement with airs test cases in the nu_3 spectral region.
   (S.A. Clough, M.W. Shephard, V.H. Payne)

2) The the value of chi for co2 set to 1. This has been made possible because the
   apparent sub-lorentzian line shape at the nu_3 bandhead is now taken care of with 
   Niro et al. (2005) line coupling.
   (S.A. Clough, M.W. Shephard, V.H. Payne)

Very Important: Since the CO2 continuum and the CHI factor depend on the line
coupling, the line coupling must be used in the calculations in order to obtain accurate
results.  Therefore, accompanying this LBLRTM release a new line file 
containing Niro et al. (2005) line coupling parameters (aer_v_2.0) and corresponding 
LNFL_v_2.4 program that converts the ascii line file into an input binary file for
LBLRTM.  


LBLRTM_v10.7

1)  The option for reading spectral cloud optical depths has been changed:
    IAERSL must now be set to 5 to invoke this option
    (S.A. Clough)

2) Modification was made so that the correct 'plotting' of transmittances from
   optical depths occurs.
   (S.A. Clough)

3) Number of input levels (sonde levels) has been increased to 6000.
   (S.A. Clough and J. Delamere)

4) A test has been added for ikmax to provide a proper result for a horizontal (or single) layer with aerosols.
   (S.A. Clough)

5) Capability to scale cross section (xs) profiles has been added.
   (S. A. Clough)

6) Incorrect implementation of IMRG 40 and 41 (42 and 43) option  for Analytic Jacobians has been corrected.
   (S. A. Clough)

7) A change was made to enable execution with g95 in single and double precision.

8) A change was made to enable the proper opening/closing of file. 
   (M.W. Shephard, J. Gu, and D. Feldman) 

9) Variable specifications were modified to be consistent within the module and to ensure proper performance with the single precision solar file for both single and double versions of lblrtm.
   (S. A. Clough)

LBLRTM_v10.3

1) Treatment of mixing ratios has been made more consistent and the volume molar
   density has been treated more precisely.  For example, the coding was modified 
   to allow for variable mixing ratios of nitrogen and oxygen.  This is useful for
   mixing ratios of nitrogen and oxygen different from earth values.
   (S.A. Clough)

2) Continuum module was also made more flexible for atmospheres that do not have
   fixed nitrogen and oxygen values. (S.A. Clough)

3) The nitrogen collision induced fundamental has been modified using data provided
   by Walter Lafferty at NIST.  There is minimal change in the results from the previous implementation. 
   (S.A. Clough, W. Lafferty, and E.J. Mlawer)

4) Fixed an error in the coding of the subroutines that load the continuum coefficients into the arrays.  
   Roundoff protection was not provided and in certain cases the loading of the array could be in error by one element.
   (S.A. Clough)

5) Fixed an associated with the new scaling capability has been found and fixed.
   (S.A. Clough and M.W. Shephard)     
   
6) The role of IOD=3 has been made more general and more robust. (see instructions)
   (K.E. Cady-Pereira and S.A. Clough)

7) IMRG=10 is no longer an available option.  The same results can be obtained with IMRG=1.
   (S.A. Clough and K.E. Cady-Pereira)

LBLRTM_v10.1

1) Modifed the program so that the layer optical depth calculation options
   work as specified in the instructions and are consistent with versions previous to LBLRTM_v10.0.
   (S.A. Clough and M.W. Shephard)

Lblrtm_v10.0

1) Modified the Analytic Jacobian calculations to be more efficient and accurate.
   (S.A. Clough)

2) Added the capability to scale the molecular profile values
   (S.A. Clough)

3) MT_CKD_v1.3 : Modified CO2 continuum based primarly on LBLRTM validations with SHIS/TES/AIRS observations
   (M.W. Shephard)

4) Correction for horizontal propagation with aerosols for any altitude above 1 m (0.001 km).
   (T. Scharlemann and S.A. Clough)   

5) Modified LBLRTM implementation of TIPS so that it can handle molecules with HITRAN
   molecule numbers larger than 33.
   (S.A. Clough and M.W. Shephard)

6) Also, available for the LBLRTM calculations are additonal CO2 P/Q/R line coupling adapted
   from Niro et al. (2005) for the CO2 v2 (600-800 cm-1). The line coupling
   parameters are provide with the spectroscopic line parameters and in the LNFL
   (www.rtweb.aer.com) example.  LNFL merges the line coupling parameters with a
   spectroscopic line database to create input spectroscopic  
   parameters for LBLRTM.

   (S.A. Clough and R. Tipping)

LBLRTM_v9.1

1)The foreign water vapor continuum has been modified in the 250 - 500 cm-1 region to 
  provide improved agreement with AERI_extended_range measurements from SHEBA and 
  North Slope of Alaska (NSA).  The consequence is that in this spectral region, 
  the mt_ckd_1.1 foreign continuum provides results similar to those previously 
  obtained with ckd_2.4.1 (S.A. Clough and J. Delamere).

   by EUMETSAT and designed to require a minimal amount of setup on the part of 
   the user while exploiting pre-existing LBLRTM calculation options.  Refer to user
   instructions and additional documentation for more details.   
   (H. Snell, M.W. Shephard, S.A. Clough, and S. Tjemkes)  

LBLRTM_v8.4

1) Minor bug fixs to the LOWTRAN7 routin in LBLRTM (lbllow.f) that
   includes the moving of an ENDIF to the proper location and the
   proper alignment of ZMDL and ALTZ arrays
   (S.A. Clough and S. Shald)

2) In the continuum module, the coding of the partial pressure of water vapor has
   been simplified by introducing a varaiable h2o_frac.  The factor of 1.e-20 has
   been removed from Wtot.  In conjunction with this, the factor of 1e-20 has been 
   removed from the calculation of fractions for the other species, including the 
   Rayleigh scattering section.
   (S.A. Clough)

3) The common blocks in several subroutines have been modified to eliminate compiler
   Warning Messages
   (S.A. Clough)

2) Added makefiles and utilities to run LBLRTM on LINUX INTEL.
   (M.W. Shephard and H. Nair) 

LBLRTM_v8.1


1) The partition function routine has been changed to TIPS_2003
    Fischer,J., R.R. Gamache, A. Goldman, L.S. Rothman and A. Perrin.
    Total internal partition sums for molecular species in the 2000
    edition of the HITRAN database, JQSRT 2003;82:401-412.
    (S.A. Clough)

2) The number of molecules that can be handled is 38, consistent with 
   HITRAN 2000.
   (S.A. Clough)

3) The chi factor for carbon dioxide has been modified.  The chi factor is 
   now computed in a separate subroutine.
   (S.A. Clough)

4) The cumulus cloud option is now working. 
   (S.A. Clough and M.W. Shephard)

5) The line coupling coefficients for the oxygen lines in the microwave 
   region have been modified based on the data of Cimini et al. (2003).
   (K. Cady-Pereira and S.A. Clough)

6) The method of handling the temperature correction for transitions with  
   unknown lower state energies has been modified.
   (S.A. Clough and M.W. Shephard)

7) The CO2 Mixing Ratio parameter read from TAPE5 (if non zero) prevails 
   over all other input values.  This provides a ready means to globally 
   change the carbon dioxide mixing ratio.
   (S.A. Clough)

8) Spectral range over which carbon dioxide continuum has been increased 
   by a factor of 7.0 has been extended to 0-1200 cm-1.

    See the release notes for the MT_CKD continuum for further details.
    (E.J. Mlawer, D.C Tobin and S.A. Clough)

2) LBLRTM modified to read the single precision SOLAR.RAD file when
    running LBLRTM in double precision (solar applications)
    (S.A. Clough).

    (M.W. Shephard)

4) For LBLATM (IATM=1), volume mixing ratio values on TAPE6 (output) have
    been changed from ppv to ppmv with the units indicated in the text.
    This provides consistency with volume mixing ratio input for LBLATM (TAPE5).
    Note that the vmr variables internal to the code are ppv.
    (M.W. Shephard)
